# Key Challenges of Multi-Threading

Multi-Threading enables you to perform multiple tasks concurrently, making your applications faster and more responsive.
However, it introduces complexities that can lead to challenging problems if not managed correctly.

## Race Conditions
- **What It Is**: When multiple threads try to read and write shared data at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Example**: Imagine two people trying to withdraw money from a bank account simultaneously. Without proper coordination,
   both might withdraw more money than is available.

## Deadlocks
- **What It Is**: A situation where two or more threads are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, causing a standstill.
- **Example**: Two people each need what the other is holding. Both wait forever for the other to move first.

## Thread Interruption
- **What It Is**: The ability to signal a thread to stop what it's doing and terminate gracefully.
- **Example**: If you need a worker to stop, you send them a "stop" signal.

## Concurrency Bugs
- **What It Is**: Errors that occur due to improper handling of thread interactions, often appearing as sporadic issues.
- **Example**: If two workers are writing to the same file without coordination, parts of their work might get mixed up.

## Memory Consistency Errors
- **What It Is**: When different threads have outdated or inconsistent views of shared memory.
- **Example**: If one person updates a shared document, but others see an old version, they might work with incorrect information.

## Resource Contention
- **What It Is**: Multiple threads competing for the same limited resource, leading to delays.
- **Example**: If several workers need to use the same printer at once, they might have to wait their turn.

## Starvation
- **What It Is**: When a thread is constantly denied access to resources because other threads are given priority.
- **Example**: If a worker is always overlooked in favor of others, they never get to do their job.
